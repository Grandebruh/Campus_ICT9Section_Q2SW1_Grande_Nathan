			<td class="text-center">I like Flying Gorrila because of it's deep lore and great understanding of modern issues and the importance of everyone uniting under one cause, and also the importance of diversity in nationality, ethnicity, and beliefs. Furthermore, it's riveting gameplay, and realism will leave players, like myself, in awe and in the brink of tears due to its 5 star storytelling and the connections we make with the characters.</td>

			<td class="text-center">Builder is one of my favorite characters because of his blatand disregard for the rights given by the 2nd Amendment. He takes away the guns of roblox as if it incites violence (i'm still mad about it).</td>
